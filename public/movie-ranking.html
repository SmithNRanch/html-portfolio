<hr />
<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>Oogie Boogie is my favorite character. I know all the songs by heart.</p>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>This movie has so much emotion to it, it really is a heart wrencher.</p>
<h3>Elf</h3>
<p>I think this movie is a great way to show how different people can be, when they are form different worlds on the planet.</p>
